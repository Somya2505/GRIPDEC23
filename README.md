Task 6 - Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm
Iris Flower Classification is a machine learning project centered on the task of identifying and categorizing iris flowers into distinct species based on measurable botanical features. The project primarily employs the renowned Iris dataset, a collection of precise measurements including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three distinct iris species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

The objective of Iris Flower Classification is to develop and train a classification model capable of autonomously discerning the species of an iris flower given its morphological characteristics. This project serves as an introductory exploration into the field of machine learning, providing hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.

Key components of the project include data preprocessing to ensure the dataset's quality, exploratory data analysis for insightful visualizations and pattern recognition, model selection where the Decision Tree algorithm is often employed for its simplicity and interpretability, and thorough evaluation of the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.

The visualization of the trained Decision Tree adds an interpretive layer to the project, offering insights into the hierarchical decision-making process of the model. Iris Flower Classification, owing to its simplicity and well-defined nature, serves as a foundational project in machine learning education, enabling learners to grasp essential concepts while gaining practical skills applicable to broader data science contexts. The project's scope extends beyond mere classification, providing a stepping stone for further studies in machine learning and pattern recognition.
